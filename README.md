# Dicee Game

This is a simple dice game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a two-player game where each player rolls a dice, and the player with the higher number wins.

## Getting Started

To play the game, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You will see two dice and a "Refresh Me" button. Clicking the button will roll the dice and determine the winner.

## How It Works

The game uses JavaScript to generate two random numbers between 1 and 6, which correspond to the numbers on the dice. It then changes the src attribute of the img elements to display the appropriate dice images. Finally, it compares the two numbers and displays the winner or a tie on the screen.
